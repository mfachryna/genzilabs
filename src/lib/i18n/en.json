    "storyPara1": "So here's the story. Back in college, we were always brainstorming ideas to start our own business to earn extra pocket money, while also honing our skills and gaining life experience. It started with gadget repair services, then we took on web and design projects offered by others. Typical IT student side jobs. The result? Enough for coffee, hanging out, and we got that feeling of \"wow, I can earn my own money!\"",
    "storyPara2": "When we were close to graduation, we got attracted to the dream of working at startups. The benefits were amazing - great salaries, cool culture, stock options, etc. Some of us tried applying, but it ended up as just nice tries and maybe not our luck yet. That's when the idea came up \"What if we build our own startup?\" At first we were super excited, with many ideas like \"our product must do this and that, if it works out it'll definitely explode\". But reality hit us hard and we realized our business experience was basically zero. So that dream was put on hold, we chose to work according to our passions to gather experience and stability.",
    "storyPara3": "Time passed, and \"Adulting\" really started to hit. The beautiful hopes from our youth started facing reality. Many things made us think again - fear of running out of money before payday, fear of not being able to buy a house because property prices are insane, fear of not having savings for marriage (optional honestly, traveling the world sounds better?) or helping parents, fear of sudden layoffs like the waves happening recently. Especially in this Gen Z adult era, we're haunted by many things - anxiety about job security, side hustles that never profit, inflation that keeps raising even coffee prices, burnout from working 24/7. The country's situation also adds mental burden - confusing government policies, piling new taxes, economic ups and downs making the future hard to predict.",
    "storyPara4": "But precisely because of those thoughts, the old dream that had sunk before surfaced again. Now we have more mature work experience, sharpened skills, plus some other supporting factors that seemed to say \"isn't it time to test our knowledge?\". Finally, Genzi Meraih Mimpi was born!",
    "storyPara5": "TBH we want to increase income and live more comfortably. BUT more than that, there's this feeling of \"what can we do for society?\" in the midst of our country's current condition. We're restless seeing brilliant ideas from Indonesian youth just passing by in hangout conversations. We believe Gen Z's potential is huge if channeled properly, it can explode!",
