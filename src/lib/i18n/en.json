    "storyPara1": "So here's the tea, everyone. Back in college, we were always brainstorming ideas to start our own business to earn extra pocket money, while also sharpening our skills and gaining life experience. It started with gadget repair services, then we took on web and design projects offered by others. Typical IT student side jobs lah. The result? Enough for coffee, hanging out, and we got that feeling of 'wow, I can earn my own money!'",
    "storyPara2": "When we were close to graduating, we got attracted to the dream of working at startups. Y'know the benefits are insane – great salaries, cool culture, stock options, etc. Some of us tried applying, but it ended up as just nice try and maybe not our luck yet. That's when the idea came up 'What if we build our own startup?' At first we were super hyped, with many ideas like 'our product must do this and that, if it works out it'll definitely blow up'. But reality slapped us hard and we realized our business experience was basically zero. So that dream was put on hold, we chose to work according to our passions to gather experience and stability.",
    "storyPara3": "Time passed, and 'Adulting' really started hitting different. The beautiful hopes from our youth started facing reality. Many things made us think again – fear of running out of money before payday, fear of not being able to buy a house because property prices are insane, fear of not having savings for marriage (honestly optional tho, traveling the world sounds better right?) or helping parents, fear of sudden layoffs like the waves happening recently. Especially in this Gen Z adult era, we're haunted by so many things – anxiety about job security, side hustles that never profit, inflation that keeps raising even coffee prices, burnout from working 24/7. The country's situation also adds mental burden – confusing government policies, piling new taxes, economic ups and downs making the future hard to predict.",
    "storyPara4": "But precisely because of those thoughts, the old dream that had sunk before resurfaced. Now we have more mature work experience, sharpened skills, plus some other supporting factors that seemed to say 'isn't it time to test our knowledge?' Finally, Genzi Meraih Mimpi was born!",
    "storyPara5": "TBH we want to increase income and live more comfortably. BUT more than that, there's this feeling of 'what can we do for society?' in the midst of our country's current condition. We're restless seeing brilliant ideas from Indonesian youth just passing by in hangout conversations. We believe Gen Z's potential is massive if channeled properly, it can blow up!",
